* The Impcore language in OCaml
Here.

Some OCaml,

#+begin_src ocaml
let x = 42 in x
#+end_src

** Metavariables

x, =x= $x_1$, \(x_1\).

\begin{array}{cc}
  a & b \\
  c & c
\end{array}

| $e$ | Any expression                                           |
| $d$ | Any definition                                           |
| $n$ | Any numeral                                              |
| $x$ | Any name that is meant to refer to variable or parameter |
| $f$ | Any name that is meant to refer to a function            |

** Environments

- Environment $\xi$ holds values for global variables.
- Environment $\phi$ holds definitions of functions.
- Environment $\rho$ holds values of a function's parameters.

Environments $\xi$ and $\phi$ are global and shared, but there is a distinct $\rho$ for every function call. Together, their contents comprise Impcore's /basis/.
