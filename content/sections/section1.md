## About the Compiler Team

For small to medium businesses operating high-value computing systems, which need to iterate fast but cannot afford to introduce bugs, we are experts in allowing software solutions that are correct by construction.

While the rest of the industry build and deploy software to be tested in the field, we apply state-of-the-art research on programming languages and compilers to allow bug-free software.

Our pragmatic approach results in systems that perform to specifications and can be deployed in high-risk environments.
