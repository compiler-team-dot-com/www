## About the Compiler Team

For small to medium businesses operating high-value computing systems, who
cannot afford to introduce bugs but still need to iterate fast,
we are experts in the construction of solutions that are correct by
construction.

Unlike the current state of affairs where software is deployed to be tested in
the field, our application of state-of-the-art research on programming languages and
compilers enable the introduction of software that is bug-free and perform
to specification.
