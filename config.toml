# Optionally, you can include or exclude specific files.
# See https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Glob for the glob pattern syntax.
# If non-empty, the pattern is matched against the local path.
# All paths are matched against in their filepath.ToSlash form.
# If exclude is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path matches it, that file is not synced.
# If include is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path does not match it, that file is not synced.
# As a result, local files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not uploaded to remote,
# and remote files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not deleted.
# include = "**.html" # would only include files with ".html" suffix
# exclude = "**.{jpg, png}" # would exclude files with ".jpg" or ".png" suffix
